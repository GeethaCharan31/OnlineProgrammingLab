OnlineProgrammingLab

Python 3.9 is being used, Pycharm IDE
Project,Virtual Environment is created and then django is installed
" pip install django "

Use "django-admin" to check if django is installed, it should give the list of commands.

Now to create django project -- " django-admin startproject OnlineProgrammingLab . "
In the command '.' is used to remove redundancy as django creates folder inside folder by default
This will create manage.py and OnlineProgrammingLab folder

manage.py is the wrapper around django-admin so from now on we use manage.py inplace of django-admin
so because of this we use " python manage.py runserver " to run the project instead of
" django-admin runserver "

Once we run the command we get http://127.0.0.1:8000 where the website is running , we should see the
django default page

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To create an app inside django-project we use
" python manage.py startapp APP_NAME "
Now to connect this app to our django project we go settings.py and add our app there
i.e in ALLOWED_APPS we add new enter 'base.apps.BaseConfig' or simply 'base'

Now we create an urls.py for our app as we cannot call our views from the project urls.py

Simple View Example:
                        def home(request):
                            return HttpResponse("Home Page")
this view is triggered at starting so we add to base/url.py
                        path('', views.home, name="home"),

we write functions in views which are triggered by urls -- These urls config is present in base/urls.py
now we config the base/urls.py to the project-urls.py
To do this we add
" path('',include('base.urls')), " to the project-urls.py

Everytime we add a view we should add corresponding url to base/urls.py
and everytime we create new app that app.urls should be included into the project-urls.py
