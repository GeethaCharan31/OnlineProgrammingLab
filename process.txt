OnlineProgrammingLab

Python 3.9 is being used
Virtual Environment is created and then django is installed
" pip install django "

Use "django-admin" to check if django is installed, it should give the list of commands.

Now to create django project -- " django-admin startproject OnlineProgrammingLab . "
In the command '.' is used to remove redundancy as django creates folder inside folder by default
This will create manage.py and OnlineProgrammingLab folder

manage.py is the wrapper around django-admin so from now on we use manage.py inplace of django-admin
so because of this we use " python manage.py runserver " to run the project instead of
" django-admin runserver "

Once we run the command we get http://127.0.0.1:8000 where the website is running , we should see the
django default page
